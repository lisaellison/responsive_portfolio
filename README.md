# responsive_portfolio

This is a responsive portfolio using Bootstrap CSS and semantic HTML

## Phase 1: Index/About Me

- created the pages with HTML5 with Bootstrap 4 link
- drafted site header/navbar, decided colorscheme & fonts for all three pages, linked to Google Fonts (recursive)
- drafted "about me" section on index, added image, wrote bio, style work (recursive)
- created sticky footer, all three pages
- more work on style of about me page (and more after that), switch to larger image
- pushed nav links all the way to the right with a reversed flex row

## Phase 2: Portfolio

- created basic cards with images
- created buttons (2) and links (3)
- added padding between header & cards and between cards & footer
- fought with columns, applied strethched-links to three "forthcoming" blocks. Not confident columns are set up correctly.

## Phase 3: Contact

- make outline of funcitonal contact form
- created two small text boxes and one textarea box for information
- created a submit button

## Clean-up

- put all images in a folder
- worked on style issues

## Future improvements

- improve margin on right side of About page (text)
- make the header navbar drop down to a 2nd line for xs screen size
- center buttons on 1st two portfolio cards
- make contact form functional

## Comment on HTML validation

- most trouble came from HTML tags not being properly named or nested

## Revision (7/11/2020)

- Added links to three recent projects: will adjust height of images so they're the same & not fuzzy
- Added resume page & embedded resume: text is not appearing upon returning to it; will correct
- No changes made to contact page yet.
